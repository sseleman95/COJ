 //Propiedades
The number of correct bracket sequences consisting of n opening and n closing brackets.
The number of binary trees with root n +1 leaves (vertices are numbered).
Number of ways to separate completely the brackets n +1 the multiplier.
The number of triangulations of a convex n +2 -Gon (ie, the number of partitions of a polygon into triangles by nonintersecting diagonals).
Number of ways to connect 2n points on a circle n disjoint chords.
The number of non-isomorphic full binary trees with n internal nodes (ie having at least one son).
The number of monotonic paths from the point of (0,0) the point (N, n) in a square lattice size n \ times n , Not rising above the main diagonal.
The number of permutations of length n You can sort the stack (it can be shown that the permutation is sorted stack if and only if there is no such index i <j <k That a_k <a_i <a_j .)
The number of partitions of a set of continuous n elements (ie, partitions into continuous blocks).
Amount ways to cover the ladder 1 \ ldots n with n rectangles (referring to the figure, consisting of n columns i Th of which has a height i .)
